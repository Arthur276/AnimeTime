# AnimeTime

AnimeTime is a project developed by Arthur276.

Its goal is to provide to the user an easy way to follow the anime series that he is watching.

For the moment, AnimeTime is only a little python script, but in the future, i will try to add a website to describe the project, a mobile app and also a discord bot.

Stay tuned for what's to come !
